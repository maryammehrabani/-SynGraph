**Environment Setup**

You can install the packages step by step


 ```
pip install nltk
pip install gensim
pip install dhg
```

**Usage**

You can download all data from  https://github.com/maryammehrabani/SynGraph/tree/master/DATA

Required functions:

```
python function.py
```

**Property Prediction Model**


1.Prepare data

```
python knowledge_graph.py
```
```
python feature_enhancment.py
```
The outputs generated by knowledge_graph.py and feature_enhancement.py, namely KG_cell_line_feature.xlsx and drug_feature.xlsx, have been saved in the DATA directory and do not require re-execution if not necessary.
2.Training

```
python main.py
```
